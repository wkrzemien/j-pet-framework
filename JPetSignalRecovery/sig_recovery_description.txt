Implementation of signal recovery method

matrices dimensions:

A 	- matrix of size (300 x 45)
P 	- matrix of size (45  x 45)
m 	- vector of size (300 x  1)

A, P, m need to be loaded from data-base (a priori information).

omega	- vector of size (8   x  1)
yb	- vector of size (8   x  1)

omega, yb are from experiment (measured time and voltage). Vectors have the same 
size equal to 2 * number of thresholds (here 4 thresholds are assumed).

It is assumed the lowest threshold value was equal to -60 mV. This value deterimes the synchronization
process of signals used to calculate A, P, m.
Test is based on experimental data which were used to validate the matlab implementation.
